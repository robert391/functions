1. I did this by creating a function called evenorodd. This function sees if it is odd or even by doing an and operand with 1. If it's 0, then it's even. If it's not 0, then it's odd. It could also be done by dividing by 2 and finding its remainder. If the remainder is 0, it's even. If it's 1, it's odd. It then jump to the condition if it's even. For this, it will put the message and then the length of the message in the stack. It will then jump in the place to print the message.
2. Some challenges was where to put the input variables. I needed to decide where I could put the input variables. First, I decided to put them in the registers. I saw that this wouldn't make it a function but a procedure. So I decided to put the inputs in the stack instead.
3. See the code file.
